MySQL Sub languages:
   MySQL also like other RDBMS, uses SQL which is divided as several sub languages based on functionality
  i. DDL(Data Definition language)
 ii. DML(Data Manipulation Language)
iii. DQL(Data Query Language)
iv.DCL(Data Control Language)
v.TCL(Transaction Control language)

   i. DDL : These command are used to define a database,table,view etc., .They provide structure & Definition
    Eg:create, drop, truncate, alter, rename
  ii. DML : These commands are used to manipulate the data
      Eg: Insert,Delete,Update 
 iii. DQL : These commands are used to retrive the data using Queries
     Eg:  select
iv. DCL : These commands are used to control the data
     Eg:GRANT,REVOKE
v.  TCL: These commands are used to control the transactions
     Eg: commit, rollback,savepoint 

DataTypes In MySQL:
    MySQL supports  various data types to store different kinds of data
    INT: it is used to store integer values (we can also use tinyInt,smallInt,bigInt)
    Decimal(M,D) -- it is used to store decimal values where M is the maximum total digits and D is the maximum digits after decimal
      eg: decimal(5,2) ---> 43.94
   varchar  -- it is used to store alphanumeric values(strings) with variable length
      varchar(10) -- a,a476,prasad
  char(n) -- it is used to store alphanumeric values(strings) with fixed length
     char(3) -- god, don,223
   text -- it is used for larger texts such as articles , paragraphs etc..,
  date -- it is used to enter the date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  time -- it is used to store the time in HH:MM:SS format
   we can also used combined one 'datetime' and alone 'year' datatypes)
  Boolean -- it is used to store true or false.

what is the difference between char and varchar?
  char(n) -- uses strings of exact n characters in length  
      eg: char(4) --john, raj3, a@#p
  varchar(n) -- uses strings of maximum n characters in length
      eg: varchar(4) -- john, god, ox, p

Database Design in MySQL: 
    Every Database need to be designed well structured with tables and relations among them. basic principles in db design are
   Data Integrity: Aviod redundancy
   Security: proper access controls
   Performance: optimise the databases
 and we follow basic Normalization
   1NF(first Normal Forms) : Each column should contain atomic values, no repeating groups
   eg:  before 1NF:    
                           sno   name             address
                            1     PRASAD        HYD,TS,India
                            2      John               warangal,TS,India

        after 1NF
                          sno      name          city        state    country
                           1       PRASAD    HYD     TS        India
                           2        John            warangal TS       India

    2NF:  it should meet 1NF  and no dependency between non key columns. All columns should depend primary key
     eg:  sid   sname    cid    cname   staff_name
             1     john       101   DB     PRASAD
             2     jessica    103   react   PRASAD

            sid   sname    cid                 cid   cname
             1     john       101                101   DB
             2     jessica    103                103  raect
   
  3NF : it should meet 2 NF and No transitive dependency (no non key column should dependent on other non key column
      eg:   cid      cname    staff name       staff number
              101     DB            PRASAD      46546546
              102     react           John               2323232

             cid      cname   sid               sid     staff name       staff number
              101     DB       125               125   PRASAD      46546546
              102     react      126              126    John               2323232
