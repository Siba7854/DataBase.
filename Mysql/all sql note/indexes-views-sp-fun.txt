Indexes: index is used to find the value or row easily. it is used to retieve large amount of data easily. it is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrival
   create index index_name on tablename(columnname)

   drop index index_name on tablename

   create index staff_name ON staff(tname);

drop index staff_name on staff

Trigger:  A trigger is a set of actions that are automatically executed in response to some events . we can use before, after triggers

create trigger trigger_name after insert on tablename
for each row
     set new_value= updated value

eg:  create trigger delete_payment after delete on  staff
for each row
  begin
      delete from payments where id = staff.id
  end

views: views are the temporary tables created from query results
create view viewname as 
query

drop view viewname

Stored Procedures: A stored Procedure is a set of SQL statements that can be executed repeatedly. it improves security, performance and code reusability

create Procedure Procedurename(IN parameters)
begin
   query
end

call Procedurename(parameters)
delimiter //
create procedure getByName
(in n varchar(20),)
begin
  select *
  from staff
  where tname=n;
end //

call getByName("Raju");

functions: functions are also used for reusability but function must return a value. usually functions are used for calculations

create function functionnae(parameters) returns datatype
 begin
    query
  return value;
 end

 select functionname //calling
