Data Query Language(DQL):
     It is used to write Queries on existing tables. Query is a command or instruction to database for retrieving, analysing or modifying the data
   SELECT command is used to select columns when retrieving the data

write a query to display tname and salary from staff table
select tname,salary from staff;

write a query to display all rows from a table
select * from staff;

CLAUSES IN MySQL:
    MYSQL Clauses are used to specify conditions , filter data and control the flow of queries . They are:
   i. WHERE Clause: It is used to filter the data using a condition
 write a query to display tname and salary from staff table whose age is greater than 30
     For using WHERE clause conditions, we can use different operators. Most used operators in MySQL are
     a. Arithematic operators: These operators are used to perform arithematic operators such as +,-,*,/,%   
     b. logical operators: These operators are used to perform logical operations on multiple conditions such as  and(&&),or(||),not(!)
   c. Relational operators(comparison ) : These operators are used for comparing . Eg: > , <, >= ,<= , = ,!=(<>)
  d. string operators: These are used to perform operations on strings
      LIKE : it is used to bring strings that follow specific pattern
write a query to display all values of teachers whose name starts with 'j'
        select *
from staff
where tname like 'j%'

   here % represents any character of any length
   we can also use '_'  --> it represents any single character     
write a query to display all values of teachers whose name second letter is 'a'
select *
from staff
where tname like '_a%'
write a query to display all values of teachers whose name second letter from last is 'a'
write a query to display all values of teachers whose name second letter from last is not 'a'
select * from staff where tname not like '%a_';

  v. special operators: we can use special operators such as 
      IN  -- used to find details in specific data list
    NOT IN -- used to find details who are not in the list
    BETWEEN -- used to find data between specific values
    NOT BETWEEN -- used to find data not between specific values
    IS NULL -- used to find data whose column value is null
    IS NOT NULL--  used to find data whose column value is not null
