Joins: Joins are used to combine multiple tables such that the result of the query retrieved from both the tables. There are different types of Joins
   i. inner Join
   ii. Left Join
   iii. right Join
   iv. Full Outer Join
   v. cross Join
   vi. Self Join

i. Inner Join : Inner Join is used to retrieve common data between the tables

select t1.columnName,t2.columnName
from table1 as t1
inner Join
table2 as t2
ON condition



select Customers.first_name,Customers.last_name,Shippings.status
from Customers
inner Join
Shippings
ON Customers.customer_id=Shippings.customer

ii. left JOIN :  left join is used to retieve left table complete results along with common data
select t1.columnName,t2.columnName
from table1 as t1
left Join
table2 as t2
ON condition

select t1.tname, t2.class_name
from staff as t1
left join
classes as t2
on t1.tid=t2.classTeacherId

Right Join:   Right Join is used to retrieve the data which is completely from right table and common data from left table

select t1.columnName,t2.columnName
from table1 as t1
right Join
table2 as t2
ON condition

Full Outer Join: It is union of both tables where result is all from left table and all from right table
In MYSQL, Full outer Join is not directly Possible. Instead we can combine left join and right join using "union" command


tas1: print cutomer names along with no of items they bought

select t1.first_name,t1.last_name,count(t2.item)
from Customers as t1
left join
Orders as t2
ON t1.customer_id= t2.customer_id
group by t2.item


cross join: A cross Join returns the cartesian product of two tables with each row of one table combined with each row of other table
eg: we have two tables
id    color
1     red
2     blue
3     green

id   shape
1    round
2    square
3    triangle

select t1.color, t2.shape
from Colors as t1
cross join Shapes as t2

color    shape
red      round
red      square
red      triangle
blue     round
blue     square
blue     triangle
Green    round
Green    square
Green    triangle


self join:  A self join is a join operation  where a table is joined to itself
as if it were two tables

employees
   eid     ename     m_id
   101    john        103
   102    raj         103
   103    priya       104
   104    prasad      null

    eid     ename     m_id
   101    john        103
   102    raj         103
   103    priya       104
   104    prasad      null

   print ename with managers names

   select t1.ename,t2.ename
   from employees as t1
   inner join
   employees as t2
   ON t1.m_id=t1.id

 employees
   eid  ename  department
   1    john    sales
   2    swathi  sales
   3    rani    HR
   4    Mike    sales


   can you find pairs of same department
  select t1.ename, t2.ename
  from employees as t1
  inner join
  employees as t2
  ON t1.department=t2.department and t1.eid<t2.eid
