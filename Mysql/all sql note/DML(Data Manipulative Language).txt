DML(Data Manipulative Language): These commands are used to manipulate the data i.e., insert,update or delete the data in table.
   Insert a row into table:  The INSERT  command is used to add new data to tables
   INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1,value2...)
 The values should follow same order as columns
To Insert Multiple rows mention data separated by comma
   INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1,value2...),(value1,value2...),(value1,value2...)....
To Insert data into specific columns, we can use
  INSERT INTO tables_name (col1,col2....) VALUES (value1,value2....)

UPDATE : UPDATE is used to modify or change the existing data in a table
   update table_name
   set col1=value1,col2=value2.....
   where condition
without where, update updates the all rows

DELETE : DELETE is used to delete the entire row based on condition
     DELETE FROM table_name where condition;


By default, workbench have auto_safe_updates as true
