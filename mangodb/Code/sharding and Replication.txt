Replication:Replication involves maintaining multiple copies of data in different nodes to ensure high availability and durability.In MongoDB , we achieve it through replica sets.
A replica Set consists of
   Primary Node: it accepts writes and copies the data to secondary nodes
   secondary Node:it is just a copy to read from primary and can become primary node if primary fails

Sharding: it is used to distribute large amount of data across multiple servers or shards to improve scalability
why do we need sharding?
   i. Server might be loaded large amount of data
   ii. read traffic of all types of users goes to single server
   iii. write traffic always change single server

data will be divided based on a value which is dicided based on shards space and cost called shard key

Indexing: Indexing is used for performance and faster query retrival
   db.collectionName.createIndex({fieldName:1})
   Indexes are separated as
    uniqueIndex(single Index): index for single fieldName
    compondIndex:index for multiple fieldNames
    text index: index for string field that can also be used for text search
